## Project Overview
The aim of this project was to design a system similar to the logical layer of the Ultimate Team mode known from EAFC games. The project involved creating a "skeleton" by designing entity classes for key components along with their relationships. One use case was fully implemented, including its complete functionality and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.

Please note that security was not a priority in this project. User validation has been simply implemented using cookies for demonstration purposes.
